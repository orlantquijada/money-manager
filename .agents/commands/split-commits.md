description: organizes mixed code changes into clear, logically separated commits with concise messages.
---

1. Please review my current changes and split them into logical, separate commits.
2. Create commits in logical order (types first, then implementation).
3. Group related changes by feature/concern, keep unrelated changes in separate commits.
4. Write concise, descriptive commit messages for each commit. Use conventional commit messages.
