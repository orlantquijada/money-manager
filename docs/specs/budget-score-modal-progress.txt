## Progress Log

### 2026-01-15 - BSM-001 API endpoint

[BSM-001] DONE - budget.scoreDetails endpoint
- Added BudgetScoreDetails type with FundDetail and Insight interfaces
- Endpoint returns: score, status, factors[], funds[], insight
- Funds sorted by status: over_budget → at_risk → on_track
- EVENTUALLY funds excluded from list
- Insight generated from largest point recovery opportunity (over_budget first, then at_risk)
- Type check passes

---

## Blockers
(none)

## Key Decisions
- (decided) Insight prioritizes over_budget funds (+20 pts) over at_risk (+5 pts)
- (decided) Utilization rounded to 1 decimal place for display
