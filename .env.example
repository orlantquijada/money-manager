# Since .env is gitignored, you can use .env.example to build a new `.env` file when you clone the repo.
# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to \`.env\`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.
# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named `.env` and populate it with your secrets.

# Database connection URLs
# For local dev, both can point to localhost
# For Neon prod: DATABASE_URL = pooled (-pooler), DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED = direct
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/main"
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/main"

# Set to "true" in Vercel prod to use Neon HTTP driver
# Leave unset for local dev to use node-postgres (wire protocol)
# USE_NEON_HTTP="true"

# `PORT` is for server/ and is only used in prod
# PORT=3000
