## Progress Log

### 2026-01-10 - Spec creation

[NNP-001] NOT STARTED - Data layer for savings progress
- Spec created with fundWithMeta extension design
- Need to confirm amountSaved vs amountLeft semantics

### 2026-01-13 - Mark as Paid mutation

[NNP-004] DONE - markAsPaid creates transaction for remaining amount
- Rewrote mutation to create transaction instead of deleting
- Calculates monthlyBudget using timeMode multiplier
- Creates transaction with note "Marked as paid"

[NNP-005] DONE - Fund detail page Mark as Paid button
- Button already exists, updated Alert text to describe new behavior
- Removed "destructive" style since it's now additive

## Blockers
(none)

## Key Decisions
- Progress bars invert for NON_NEGOTIABLE: 0→100% (savings) vs 100%→0% (spending)
- Color logic shifts from "danger as you spend" to "success as you save"
- Overfunding caps visual at 100% but shows actual amount in text
